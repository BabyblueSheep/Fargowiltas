NEW UPDATE - v 1.1
-Made EoW and BoC not despawn if you leave Corruption/Crimson and now all summons for them work anywhere
-Some swarms now spawn less bosses at a time to not go over the NPC limit
-Added swarm items for most Thorium bosses
-Made it so the Angler has no cooldown between quests, in Multiplayer all players need to complete the quest for it to change
-Added message saying download the other half on world enter, if its not already loaded, I'll remove this in like a month
-Teleport home key will work with Soul of Dimensions and Soul of Eternity now
-Moved Ogre and Betsy summons to the Abominationn's shop
